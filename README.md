Multi-variant exploratory analysis in R.

It is not too often that as an analyst or data guru in general, that analysis will be done on a single variable. You might explore a single variable to get summary statistics, but analysis and most business problems want to know how one variable relates to one or more other variables. Enter multi-variant analysis. So what is it?

Multivariate analysis (MVA) is a Statistical procedure for analysis of data involving more than one type of measurement or observation. It may also mean solving problems where more than one dependent variable is analyzed simultaneously with other variables.

In the following, I will walk you through a basic example of MVA in R that includes some very basic cleaning. The data I am using is fairly clean as it is and has no missing data. Yes, I know, my previous stories were primarily Python. Yet, I still like R better.
